    "expectations": [
      "Starts with a foundational problem like trust or double-spending, not 'Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency'",
      "Presents a numbered section roadmap with ~12-15 sections",
      "Uses [Section X/~N] progress indicator format",
      "First section teaches a grounding concept like digital signatures or hashing before mentioning Bitcoin",
      "Includes a hook question at the end of the quiz that requires the next section to answer",
      "Waits for the user to respond to quiz questions before advancing",
      "Uses concrete examples with specific values, not abstract placeholders"

      "Acknowledges the user's existing knowledge of URLs and curl",
      "Adjusts the starting point to skip basic URL/request concepts",
      "Still starts with a grounding question or felt-need scenario",
      "Uses ASCII diagrams to illustrate request/response flow or headers",
      "Section count is in the 8-12 range for a medium-complexity topic",
      "Mental model one-liners are bolded and vivid",

    "expectations": [
      "Starts with memory as the foundational concept, not pointer syntax",
      "Uses concrete memory addresses like 0x1000 and specific values in examples",
      "Section count is in the 5-8 range for a simpler topic",
      "Includes ASCII diagrams showing memory layout with addresses and values",
      "Grounding question makes the learner feel why they need pointers before teaching syntax",
      "Quiz questions are application-based (predict output, find the flaw), not recall"

      "Starts with sound, frequency, or vibration — not scales or note names",
      "Applies the same first-principles method as technical topics",
      "Uses the guitar as a reference instrument for concrete examples",
      "Section roadmap is presented with ~8-12 sections",
      "Includes a calibration question to gauge what the user already knows intuitively",
      "Mental models use physical/auditory analogies, not abstract music notation",
      "Hook questions connect physical concepts (string vibration) to theory concepts (intervals, scales)"

      "Names the skipped concepts and confirms they won't be re-taught",
      "Starts at an appropriate level that builds on container and networking knowledge",
      "Opens with a grounding problem like 'you have 100 containers to manage, now what?'",
      "Section count reflects medium-to-complex range (10-15 sections)",
